### **Level 1: Subsets and Combinations** (Basic Backtracking)

1. Generate All Subsequences of an Array ✅
2. Generate All Subsets of an Array (Power Set)
   1 and 2 are one and the same All the combinations form a power set.
3. Generate All Permutations of an Array ✅
   easier apporach is to use a spearate consumed boolean array so that we can go on with the loop easily.
   - 3.2 Generate unique permutations ✅
4. Generate All Combinations of k elements from n elements ✅ (AllCombinations.java)

   4.2 ALL Unique Combinations ✅ (AllUniqueKCombinatins.java)

   - If a number appears more than once in the array, we should only generate combinations where its first occurrence is chosen before its later occurrences.
   - If we are using a duplicate number before using its first occurrence, it means that we are forming a combination that should have already been formed when we used its first occurrence.
   - By enforcing this rule, we avoid duplicate combinations.

   **Its like say if you are using the second occurance for the first time you have already made the desired sequnce.**

5. Combination Sum I (TargetSum.java)>> what we have done is kind of step counting but in this we can
   using similar elements multiple time we can DO IT **LATER** EASY 💥
6. Combination Sum II (Unique Subsequences with Duplicates Allowed Once) >> UniqueSum.java ✅

### **Level 2: Strings and Arrangements** (Intermediate Backtracking)

7. String Permutations (All possible arrangements of a string's characters) ✅
8. Generate Valid Parentheses (n pairs of `()` in all valid orders) ✅
   **(Ques 8. Good Question >> Trust the process >> make branches on paper than implement its logic)**
9. Word Search (Find a word in a 2D grid, moving in 4 directions) ✅
10. Palindrome Partitioning (Break a string into palindromic substrings)

---

### **Level 3: Sudoku and Graph-Based Backtracking** (Advanced Backtracking)

11. Solve Sudoku (Fill a 9x9 Sudoku board using constraints)
12. N-Queens Problem (Place N queens on an NxN board with no attacks)
13. Rat in a Maze (Find paths in a grid avoiding obstacles) ✅
14. Word Break (Check if a string can be segmented using a dictionary)
15. Knight’s Tour (Find a path where a knight visits all chessboard squares exactly once)

---

### **Level 4: Constraint-Based & Hard Backtracking Problems**

16. M-Coloring Problem (Color a graph with M colors so no adjacent nodes have the same color)
17. Hamiltonian Path and Cycle (Find a path visiting all nodes exactly once in a graph)
18. Subset Sum Problem (Check if a subset with a given sum exists)
19. Kth Permutation Sequence (Find the Kth permutation of numbers 1 to N without generating all permutations)
20. Word Ladder (Transform a word into another by changing one letter at a time, using a dictionary)

## 3. **Divide & Conquer (5-7 problems)**

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search using Recursion
- Exponentiation (Power of a number)

## 4. **Recursion on Data Structures (5-7 problems)**

- Reverse a Linked List
- Check if a Linked List is Palindrome
- Height of a Binary Tree
- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversal

## 5. **Dynamic Programming with Recursion (10 problems)**

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to solve by breaking them into subproblems and storing the results of redundant calculations.
**Ways to solve a DP problem**

###### Top-Down Approach (Memoization)

Solves the original problem by recursively solving subproblems and storing results.

Steps:

1. Solve the problem recursively.
2. Store the result of each subproblem.
3. Use stored results when needed instead of recalculating.

---

###### Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)

Solves the smallest subproblems first and builds up the solution iteratively.

Steps:

1. Create an array (dp[]) to store results.
2. Start from the base case.
3. Fill the table iteratively instead of using recursion.
